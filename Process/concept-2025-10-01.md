## Research 
I am researching the symbolic meaning, history, and storytelling potential of playing card court figures. 

- Queen Argine (Clubs) is a unique figure in the traditional French playing card deck, as she is the only court card without a fixed historical, legendary, or mythological identity. While other kings, queens, and jacks are tied to recognizable figures.

- people concentrate much more when you tell them that they will be participate and not just listen

- people want to see how different storyline reaches to the end

For the puzzles, getting play testers is key. Whenever they do something you didn't expect, you can use it to add more ways of solving the puzzle.

- Experimenting with Twine, makes me to think about an ending point. I start to write about Argine's character based on what people said and felt about her and similar mythology and historical references as other court cards.
