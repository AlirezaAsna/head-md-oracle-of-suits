# Moustache
The moustache wants to fit into different places, but it doesn't belong to anywhere, so everyone rejecting it. By following the moustache you find out about some hidden details and anecdotes.

## Interaction

We use a physical razor (tracked or not) to shave the moustache (or anything else) on the screen. So the hand mouvement is tracked (x,y dimensions for sure, and maybe z).

## Story 
### WIP

It starts with the king of heart moustache thats missed printed, he ask us to shave it because it's a time anomaly. When we shave it the hair (as ink droplets) reform as a separated strong moustache that becomes alive. The user needs to erase it from existence because it shouldn't exists in the first place. The moustache escapes and search for a new owner, where to belong but it's unwanted by all the cards. Each time it encounter a new suit or card there's a small scene. The moustache looks how it fits with the card/suit.

It’s an evil moustache and it becomes happy. The moustache is angry because it’s frustrated about itself. It forces different cards/suits to have the moustache but it’s unwanted. As long as it’s progressing the moustache understand that it can’t force anyone to wear the moustache. It has to find it’s own place in the world.
